A Tic Tac Toe game server that provides an API for you to create your own Tic Tac Toe client.

* Background
This API is meant to be used at a one-day hackathon.

Therefore this API is designed in a way that it can be used in a pragmatic way, even if this might hurt some best practices in REST-API design.
* Run
** Install dependencies
#+begin_src sh
bundle install
#+end_src
** Start Rails Console
#+begin_src sh
bundle exec rails c
#+end_src
** Run all tests
#+begin_src sh
bundle exec rspec
#+end_src
* Setup Deployment via fly.io
Check out [[https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/][Installing flyctl]]

#+begin_src sh
brew install flyctl
#+end_src

[[https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/rails/][Build, Deploy and Run a Rails Application]]

#+begin_src sh
flyctl launch
#+end_src
* Deploy the app via fly.io
#+begin_src sh
fly deploy --remote-only --verbose --no-cache
#+end_src

If you are [[https://community.fly.io/t/rails-deployment-fails-error-failed-to-fetch-an-image-or-build-from-source-error-building-unexpected-eof/6028][stuck in the remote Docker build process]], try to enable websockets for data transfer:

#+begin_src sh
flyctl wg websockets enable
#+end_src
* Open the Rails Console via fly.io
#+begin_src sh
fly ssh console
bash
cd /app
bin/rails c
#+end_src
* Misc Remarks
** Random Name Generator
We want heroku-style autogenerated names for games.
We use the dictionaries of the [[https://github.com/glitchdotcom/friendly-words][Glitch word list]] as a starting point.
Combined with a postfix random number, this should allow for over 1000 * 1000 * 10_000 (10 billion) combinations.
