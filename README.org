A Tic Tac Toe game server that provides an API for you to create your own Tic Tac Toe client.

* Background
This API is meant to be used at a one-day hackathon.

Therefore this API is designed in a way that it can be used in a pragmatic way, even if this might hurt some best practices in REST-API design.
* Run
** Install dependencies
#+begin_src sh
bundle install
#+end_src
** Start Rails Console
#+begin_src sh
bundle exec rails c
#+end_src
** Run all tests
#+begin_src sh
bundle exec rspec
#+end_src
* Setup Deployment via fly.io
Check out [[https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/][Installing flyctl]]

brew install flyctl
#+end_src

[[https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/rails/][Build, Deploy and Run a Rails Application]]

* Misc Remarks
** Random Name Generator
We want heroku-style autogenerated names for games.
We use the dictionaries of the [[https://github.com/glitchdotcom/friendly-words][Glitch word list]] as a starting point.
Combined with a postfix random number, this should allow for over 1000 * 1000 * 10_000 (10 billion) combinations.
