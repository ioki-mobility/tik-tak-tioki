* Random Name Generator
We want heroku-style autogenerated names for games.
We use the dictionaries of the [[https://github.com/glitchdotcom/friendly-words][Glitch word list]] as a starting point.
Combined with a postfix random number, this should allow for over 1000 * 1000 * 10_000 (10 billion) combinations.
